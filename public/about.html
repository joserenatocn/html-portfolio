      Hi, I’m <strong>José Renato</strong>. I grew up in Brasília, Brazil, and these days I’m living in New York City.
      When I’m not working or studying, I’m usually making music (piano, guitar, or singing), out for a run, or
      training for a triathlon. I’ve always been curious about technology, but for a long time I thought coding
      was something I’d “missed the chance” to learn. Turns out it’s never too late — so here I am.
    </p>

      I finished medical school in 2022 and moved to New York for residency. Along the way, I got really interested
      in artificial intelligence and how it could change the future of healthcare. I started learning Python and
      exploring data science and machine learning. To my surprise, I found I actually enjoy the process of coding
      itself, which got me branching out into web development too.
    </p>

      This website is one of my first little projects. It’s simple on purpose — a place to practice the basics.
      As I keep learning, I’ll use it to share my progress and whatever new things I manage to build.
    </p>
